# Duoploy-Ridesourcing-market

In this work, both passengers or drivers opt for multi-homing, in which drivers work for more than one platform to maximize earnings, and passengers log in and switch a few APPs to quickly receive responses for their ride requests.

## Observable static competition

The OS competition assumes fare, waging, and matching decisions  $\theta_{0,2}$, $\theta_{1,2}$, $\theta_{2,2}$, $\lambda_{2}$, $\kappa_{1,2}$, and $\kappa_{2,2}$ are completely available to platform 1 at each time step. Accordingly, $f_{o,d,2}$, $w_{o,d,2}$, $x_{o,d,2}$, $u_{o,d,2}$, and $v_{o,d,2}$ are also completely visible to platform 1.
