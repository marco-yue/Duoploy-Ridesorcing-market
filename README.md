# Duoploy-Ridesourcing-market

This repository is the implementation of the paper "Winning the intraday competition in a duopoly ride-hailing market"

Over the past decade, ride-hailing services have reshaped how people travel in cities and substantially influenced the traditional taxi industry and transport systems. Multiple platforms co-exist and compete with each other in many local ride-hailing markets. These platforms compete not only on the demand side for passengers but also on the supply side for freelance drivers who may work for multiple platforms. In this paper, we consider a price and service time sensitive market in which two ride-hailing platforms provide substitutable services. They compete for the same group of passengers and drivers, and they decide the matching, order fare and driver wage dynamically and independently. We then examine how to win the inter-platform competition in this duopoly ride-hailing market from the perspective of a single platform. The competition is formulated as a joint matching, fare, and wage optimization problem for the controlled platform under three cases: (i) Observable static (OS) competition, (ii) Non-observable static (NOS) competition, and (iii) Non-observable dynamic (NOD) competition. We show that the proposed model helps the controlled platform to take a dominant market share and creates substantial benefits for the drivers and the passengers.
